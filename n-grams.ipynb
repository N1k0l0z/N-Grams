After the teleconference, the AFL–CIO, according to Hurd, established the \"Organizing Institute\",[4] and the goal of the institute was \"to train union organizers.\"[4] While, as Richard Hurd suggests, the attempts at reigniting the flame of union membership were largely unsuccessful,[4] in 1995, former SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL–CIO on the New Voice slate, on a platform of spreading the organizing model across the members of the federation. According to Richard Hurd, when Sweeney took over, he created an \"Organizing Department\"[4] to enhance the strategy of employing the organizing model throughout the AFL–CIO,[4] and he encouraged unions to begin \"devoting 30% of their budgets to recruitment.\"[4] The extent of the success of this is disputed, with some suggesting that more rhetoric has changed than anything, but it did have at least some effect. Richard Hurd suggests that \"The reality is that the individual national unions determine their own resource allocations and develop their own organizing programs,\"[4] but \"Most unions have increased the funding of their organizing departments, and many have devoted substantial resources to the effort.\"[4] This is how the AFL–CIO tried to implement the organizing model in response to the membership crisis.',\n",

These super unions often obliterated previous small union identities and loyalties (on both the \"left\" and \"right\" of the trade union movement) and created unions with a relatively artificial internal culture.  Often the largest union in the merger imposed its internal culture on the other divisions of the new union.  Additionally, during the period of mergers, the traditional links between members, local organisers, industrial officers, branches and the peak leaderships of unions broke down.

According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the organizing model is not inherently \"democratic\".[8] In the organizing model, the workers are not as active as they could be, and staff are still responsible for many aspects of union organizing.[8] Carter and Cooper believe that the organizing model is rather limited in terms of its scale, and it cannot start a \"...wider working class movement\".[8]',\n",

Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment, there is, the fewer jobs there will be.  The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions should emphasize their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee.

The first recorded labour strike in the United States was by Philadelphia printers in 1786, who opposed a wage reduction and demanded $6 per week in wages.[20][21] The origins of modern trade unions can be traced back to 18th-century Britain, where the Industrial Revolution drew masses of people, including dependents, peasants and immigrants, into cities. Britain had ended the practice of serfdom in 1574, but the vast majority of people remained as tenant-farmers on estates owned by the landed aristocracy. This transition was not merely one of relocation from rural to urban environs; rather, the nature of industrial work created a new class of \"worker\". A farmer worked the land, raised animals and grew crops, and either owned the land or paid rent, but ultimately sold a product and had control over his life and work. As industrial workers, however, the workers sold their work as labour and took directions from employers, giving up part of their freedom and self-agency in the service of a master. The critics of the new arrangement would call this \"wage slavery\",[22] but the term that persisted was a new form of human relations: employment. Unlike farmers, workers often had less control over their jobs; without job security or a promise of an on-going relationship with their employers, they lacked some control over the work they performed or how it impacted their health and life. It is in this context that modern trade unions emerge.',\n",

As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1799, the Combination Act was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 Rising in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the Combination Act 1825 severely restricted their activity.[citation needed]',\n",

Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire within a year.[28] To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly Voice of the People publication, having the declared intention \"to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union.\"[29]',\n",

The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually.

San Jose is Silicon Valley's largest city, the third-largest in California, and the 12th-most populous in the United States.[4] Other major Silicon Valley cities include Santa Clara, Redwood City and Cupertino. The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world (after Zürich, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution.[5] As of June 2021, it also had the highest percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more in the United States.[6]\",\n",
              " \"Silicon Valley is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000, and thousands of startup companies. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation, although the tech ecosystem has recently become more geographically dispersed.[7][8] It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the microcomputer, among other technologies, were developed. As of 2021[update], the region employed about a half million information technology workers.[9]\",\n",
              " 'As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area\\'s two other major cities, San Francisco and Oakland, the term \"Silicon Valley\" came to have two definitions: a narrower geographic one, referring to Santa Clara County and southeastern San Mateo County, and a metonymical definition referring to high-tech businesses in the entire Bay Area. The term Silicon Valley is often used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector. The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired similarly named locations, as well as research parks and technology centers with comparable structures all around the world. Many headquarters of tech companies in Silicon Valley have become hotspots for tourism.[10][11][12]',\n",
              " '\"Silicon\" refers to the chemical element used in silicon-based transistors and integrated circuit chips, which is the focus of a large number of computer hardware and software innovators and manufacturers in the region. The popularization of the name is credited to Don Hoefler.[1] The first known appearance in print was in his article \"Silicon Valley U.S.A.\", in the January 11, 1971, issue of the weekly trade newspaper Electronic News. In preparation for this report, during a lunch meeting with marketing people who were visiting the area, he heard them use this term.[13] However, the term did not gain widespread use until the early 1980s,[1] at the time of the introduction of the IBM PC and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.',\n",
              " 'The urbanized area is built upon an alluvial plain[14] within a longitudinal valley formed by roughly parallel earthquake faults. The area between the faults subsided into a graben or dropped valley.[15][16] Hoefler defined Silicon Valley as the urbanized parts of \"the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley\".[13] Before the expansive growth of the tech industry, the region had been the largest fruit-producing and packing region in the world up through the 1960s, with 39 fruit canneries.[17][18] The nickname it had been known as during that period was \"the Valley of Heart’s Delight\",[19][20]',\n",
              " \"Silicon Valley was born through the intersection of several contributing factors, including a skilled science research base housed in area universities, plentiful venture capital, permissive government regulation, and steady U.S. Department of Defense spending. Stanford University’s leadership was especially important in the valley's early development.[21] Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success.[22] The United States was more friendly than other countries to business investment, charging much lower taxes on capital gains since the Revenue Act of 1921, and featuring particularly loose free market controls over new business. In 1953, the Small Business Administration was created to foster startups, giving a boost to entrepreneurs. Northern California was even more welcoming, with a group of venture capitalists actively seeking high-tech business ideas, clustered on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and Palo Alto. California's civil code undermined the usual non-compete clauses that effectively tied employees to their companies in other states, allowing California workers to freely apply the knowledge they gained from their previous employer. This gave Silicon Valley an advantage over other American tech hubs such as Massachusetts Route 128 curving around Boston.[23]\",\n",
              " \"The San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of United States Navy research and technology. In 1909, Charles Herrold started the first radio station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in San Jose. Later that year, Stanford University graduate Cyril Elwell purchased the U.S. patents for Poulsen arc radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in Palo Alto. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.[24]\",\n",

The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there.[25]',\n",
              " \"A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to San Diego, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA) took over portions of Moffett Field for aeronautics research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms, such as Lockheed, which was the area's largest employer from the 1950s into 1980s.[26]\",\n",
              " \"Stanford University, its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of the culture of collaboration among high-tech companies.[27] A powerful sense of regional solidarity shaped the outlook of inventors and engineers in California; contrasting markedly from the insular and competitive environment of engineering firms on the East Coast of the United States.[24][28] From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the (American) West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry. Thus regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms.[29]\",\n",
              " \"Frederick Terman, as Stanford University's dean of the school of engineering from 1946,[30] encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. In 1951 Terman spearheaded the formation of Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park, an area surrounding Page Mill Road, south west of El Camino Real and extending beyond Foothill Expressway to Arastradero Road), where the university leased portions of its land to high-tech firms.[31] Terman nurtured companies like Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Lockheed Corporation, and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford University campus.\",\n",
              " \"In 1951, to address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment-opportunities for graduating students, Frederick Terman proposed leasing Stanford's lands for use as an office park named the Stanford Industrial Park (later Stanford Research Park). Terman invited only high-technology companies. The first tenant was Varian Associates, founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military-radar components. Terman also found venture capital for civilian-technology start-ups. Hewlett-Packard became one of the major success-stories. Founded in 1939 in Packard's garage by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954 Stanford originated the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the university on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal-computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home-printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand ink-jet printer in 1984.[32] Other early tenants included Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed.[33]\",\n",

Shockley\\'s work served as the basis for many electronic developments for decades.[34][35] Both Frederick Terman and William Shockley are often called \"the father of Silicon Valley\".[36][37] Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the Shockley diode), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley\\'s abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form Fairchild Semiconductor; Shockley referred to them as the \"traitorous eight\". Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, would go on to found Intel.[38][39]',\n",

Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of venture capital on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3\\xa0billion IPO of Apple Computer in December 1980.

              " 'Pinguicula vulgaris, the common butterwort, is a perennial carnivorous plant in the Lentibulariaceae family. It has a generally circumboreal distribution, being native to almost every country in Europe as well as Russia, Canada and the United States. Growing to a height of 3 to 16 centimetres (1.2 to 6.3 inches), it is topped with a purple and occasionally white funnel-shaped flower that is 15 millimetres (0.59\\xa0in) or longer. The plant, which is insectivorous, grows in damp environments such as bogs and swamps, in low or subalpine elevations. Its leaves have glands that excrete a sticky fluid that traps insects; its glands also produce digestive enzymes that work to consume the insects externally. This P.\\xa0vulgaris flower was photographed in Keila, Estonia.',\n",
